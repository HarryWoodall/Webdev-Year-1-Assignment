          <h3>What this guide is about</h3>
          <p>
            This guide will explore what the React framework is, how to get
            started with using it, some of the possibilities that can be created
            and some of the main features that makes this framework so powerful.
            If your looking to build an awesome single page web app or just
            looking to increase your knowledge in the world of front end
            development then this is the guide for you. React is a great tool
            with the ability to build fast scalable and reusable UI components,
            and after reading this guide, I hope you will have a better
            understanding of how, and how not to use it.

          <h3>What is React?</h3>
          <p>
            React is a javascript library for building user interfaces, most
            commonly single page applications. It was developed by facebook and
            released in 2013. Today it is used in websites such as Netflix and
            Instagram and is one of the most popular javascript frameworks in
            existence.

          <h3>What can it do?</h3>
          <p>
            Single page applications have become more and more common in recent
            years. And when you have all your information on one page of a
            website, it can be very difficult to manage and structure you site
            accordingly. React uses stateful modular components to help manage
            clutter and making it easy for a website to transition from one
            state to another.
          </p>
          <p>
            A big draw to react is its speed in which it can render data. It
            does this by using a lightweight virtual document object model
            called ReactDOM. When you tell react to modify part of your website,
            it updates the ReactDOM first. Then the virtual and actual DOMâ€™s get
            compared and react will only update the data that has changed, not
            the entire model.
          </p>

          <h3>How does it work?</h3>
          <p>
            React uses a syntax called JSX (Javascript extension) which is used
            primarily as a visual aid when building user interfaces as it
            resembles HTML. This is quite powerful as it connects both the view
            and the controller together seamlessly.
          </p>
          <p>
            React also uses modular structures called components. Components can
            rendered, modified or removed at runtime and even remember their own
            state. Making it easier to integrate collective data into a single
            webpage.
