          <h2>What is React?</h2>
          <p>
            React is a javascript library for building user interfaces, most
            commonly single page applications. It was developed by Facebook and
            released in 2013. Today it is used in websites such as Netflix and
            Instagram and is one of the most popular javascript frameworks in
            existence.

          <h2>What can it do?</h2>
          <p>
            Single page applications have become more and more common in recent
            years. And when you have all your information on one page, it can be
            very difficult to manage and structure. React uses stateful modular
            components to help manage content, making it easy for a website to
            transition from one state to another.
          </p>

          <h2>How does it work?</h2>
          <p>
            React uses a syntax called
            <abbr title="Javascript Extensible Markup Language">JSX</abbr>
            <dfn>(Javascript extensible markup language)</dfn> which is used
            primarily as a visual aid when building user interfaces as it
            resembles <abbr title="Hyper Text Markup Language">HTML</abbr>. This
            is quite powerful as it connects both the view controller elements
            together seamlessly.
          </p>
          <p>
            React also uses modular structures called components. Components can
            be rendered, modified or removed at runtime and even remember their
            own state. Making it easier to integrate collective data into a
            single webpage.

          <h2>What is this guide about?</h2>
          <p>
            This guide will explore what the React framework is, how to get
            started with using it, some of the possibilities that can be created
            and some of the main features that makes this framework so powerful.
            If your looking to build an awesome single page web app or just to
            increase your knowledge in the world of front end development then
            this is the guide for you. React is a great tool with the ability to
            build fast scalable and reusable UI components, and after reading
            this guide, I hope you will have a better understanding of how to
            use it.
