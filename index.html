          <h3>What is React?</h3>
          <p>
            React is a javascript library for building user interfaces, most
            commonly single page applications. It was developed by facebook and
            released in 2013. Today it is used in websites such as Netflix and
            Instagram and is one of the most popular javascript frameworks in
            existence.

          <h3>What can it do?</h3>
          <p>
            Single page applications have become more and more common in recent
            years. And when you have all your information on one page of a
            website, it can be very difficult to manage and structure you site
            accordingly. React uses stateful modular components to help manage
            clutter and making it easy for a website to transition from one
            state to another.

          <h3>How does it work?</h3>
          <p>
            React uses a syntax called JSX (Javascript extension) which is used
            primarily as a visual aid when building user interfaces as it
            resembles HTML. This is quite powerful as it connects both the view
            and the controller together seamlessly.
          </p>
          <p>
            React also uses modular structures called components. Components can
            rendered, modified or removed at runtime and even remember their own
            state. Making it easier to integrate collective data into a single
            webpage.
